        SwarNeTT leverages Wi-Fi Direct technology to form a secure, decentralized network among nearby devices, without using internet connectivity. Wi-Fi Direct systems utilize 
        Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) and Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) protocols to ensure robust security. 
        It also utilizes a publish-subscribe protocol, a decoupled messaging architecture that allows publishers to send messages based on predefined topics without needing a direct 
        connection to subscribers.
